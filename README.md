# pyVisualize
A collection of python libraries for visualizing and processing math/science objects


# features
I've created richer libraries for repeating operations by method and operator overloading.

The renderer only supports 2d graphics for now

there're libraries for Vector2, Vector3, Matrix2x2, Matrix3x3, Coordinate2, and  Coordinate3.

# future additions
I'm adding timeDelta for time dependent objects

I'm specially creating a library for vector fields, operations and visualizations.

I'm planning to add tensors.

# how to use
create objects using above keywords

create a renderer by specifying width, height, and scale

renderer.draw(objects, Coordinate2(ref point))

renderer.render()
